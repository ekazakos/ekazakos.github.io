# About me

* I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk), Bristol, UK.
My PhD project is on audio-visual action recognition, with a focus on egocentric videos. 
Im supervised by [Dima Damen](https://dimadamen.github.io).
* My research interests include multimodal video recognition and human-object interactions in egocentric videos.
Im particularly interested in studying the importance of audio,
and the modelling of audio-visual DNN architectures that can capture such interactions.
* I received both my BSc and MSc degree from [University of Ioannina](https://www.uoi.gr/en/), Ioannina, Greece,
under the supervision of [Christophoros Nikou](http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~cnikou/).
My MSc thesis was on RGB-D fusion for hand pose estimation ([paper](https://ekazakos.github.io/publications/HANDFUSION)).
