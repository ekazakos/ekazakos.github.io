## Abstract
Classification models may often suffer from “structure imbalance” between training 
and testing data that may occur due to the deficient data collection process. 
This imbalance can be represented by the learning using privileged information 
(LUPI) paradigm. In this paper, we present a supervised probabilistic classification 
approach that integrates LUPI into a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) 
model. The proposed model is called LUPI-HCRF and is able to cope with additional 
information that is only available during training. Moreover, the proposed 
method employes Student’s t-distribution to provide robustness to outliers by 
modeling the conditional distribution of the privileged information. 
Experimental results in three publicly available datasets demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach and improve the state-of-the-art in the 
LUPI framework for recognizing human activities.
